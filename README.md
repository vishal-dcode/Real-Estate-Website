# Real Estate Website
This is a single page real estate website built with React, following the tutorial by [Zainkeepscode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edBx-fjgh4k&t=6s) on YouTube. I learned React hooks, modern CSS, framer motion, and many more. We will use the Swiper js library for the slider to make this site more functional and practical.
